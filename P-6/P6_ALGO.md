### 3. **Alphabet Pyramid Program**
**Steps:**

I. [Initialize Variables]  
- Declare `n` as the number of rows (set `n = 9`).

II. [Generate Pyramid Pattern]  
- Repeat for each row `i` from 1 to `n`:
  - Print leading spaces (for loop from `i` to `n`).
  - Print alphabet characters from 'A' to the ith letter (for loop from 'A' to `('A' + i)`).
  - Move to the next line.
